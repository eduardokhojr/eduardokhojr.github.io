## Java Chips

Coming from no previous experience to JavaScript, I was eager to learn and develop my skills in a new language to code in. While learning from freeCodeCamp, I've learned that many of the coding operators are very similar to C. The only difference being quality of life changes which make coding longer programs much more enjoyable process. Compared to other coding languages like C and Python, two of which I have used before, I see myself using JavaScript much more in the future.

## My Cup of Thoughts

I think the language is very clean. Reading lines of code make a lot of sense and I am able to follow everything line by line without getting lost or not understanding anything. However, the only issue with my experience is that I have not had a lot of time with the language. As I am just experiencing it for the first time this semester, I have yet to let the language steep to something greater. As a whole, I believe that JavaScript is a great language for people to pick up since it is applicable to many environments and applications.

## Pre-Workout Cup of Joe

Athletic software engineering is an interesting way to approach teaching a programming language. This method of teaching puts students in a situation to complete a problem in a certain timeframe similar to working out in the gym. In this case, instead of a typical dumbell, we use a WOD, a "Workout of the Day". The WODs present a problem for the student to complete, depending on how long the student takes to complete the said problem this will determine their understanding and overall experience up until that point. Personally, I believe that it creates a high stress environment for students because it is a time-sensitive activity. This is good and bad at the same time by allowing students to improve their skills under pressure, however, not everyone performs well under pressure which may cause problems. While it may be enjoyable to complete a problem under the fastest timeframe, I do not believe this style of learning is not the greatest for me, but it seems to be an effective way to improve.
