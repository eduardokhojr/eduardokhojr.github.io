## Coding the Internet

HTML, the coding language of the world wide web. Learning this language is definitely as hard as learning another programming language like JavaScript. However, HTML, unlike JavaScript and other well known coding languages is used to modify the structural integrity of websites across the web. It changes the way we see, interact, and experience objects. Learning HTML may be one of the most useful and easier languages to learn and pick up as a software engineer. Just because it is easy, does not limit the potential you can create with HTML and CSS combined. Using UI frameworks like Bootstrap will not only simplify code but create different types of layouts much easier.

## Buckling in my Bootstrap

Boostrap, a HTML framework allows for easier configuration for website objects. Learning to use Bootstrap in HTML is another task on its own. When I began learning it, I faced a large learning curve. There were many aspects to remember because we are essentially using a new library. However, because the process is practically same in raw HTML it is easy to adapt figure out what you need in a simple Google search. Bootstrap definitely decreases the amount of lines I have to type but it does require some thinking so that you apply the correct format. Debugging Bootstrap HTML may be easier to look through as there is a massive return for the investment of time remembering and troubleshooting to begin with.
