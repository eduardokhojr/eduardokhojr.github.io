<h2 id="coding-the-internet">Coding the Internet</h2>

<p>HTML, the coding language of the world wide web. Learning this language is definitely as hard as learning another programming language like JavaScript. However, HTML, unlike JavaScript and other well known coding languages is used to modify the structural integrity of websites across the web. It changes the way we see, interact, and experience objects. Learning HTML may be one of the most useful and easier languages to learn and pick up as a software engineer. Just because it is easy, does not limit the potential you can create with HTML and CSS combined. Using UI frameworks like Bootstrap will not only simplify code but create different types of layouts much easier.</p>

<p>Boostrap, a HTML framework allows for easier configuration for website objects. Learning to use Bootstrap in HTML is another task on its own. When I began learning it, I faced a large learning curve. There were many aspects to remember because we are essentially using a new library. However, because the process is practically same in raw HTML it is easy to adapt figure out what you need in a simple Google search. Bootstrap definitely decreases the amount of lines I have to type but it does require some thinking so that you apply the correct format. Debugging Bootstrap HTML may be easier to look through as there is a massive return for the investment of time remembering and troubleshooting to begin with.</p>

<p>After using Bootstrap for HTML coding, I find that it is very useful. I get to declutter my css file while also creating websites with decent design like shown above. I find them especially useful in applications like this class. Bootstrap allows me to actually read through my code and understand the layers which I can change based on what I want. Using raw HTML and CSS I find myself having lots of tiny edits to get things to line up exactly the way I want it to. With Bootstrap, I no longer have to worry about these small things. I think software engineers will greatly benefit from using a framework like Bootstrap. While I do not know the distinct differences between Bootstrap and other HTML frameworks, I believe using one will allow for a much more efficient work environment.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I have found that my overall experience with Bootstrap has been very positive. I did see that there was a giant learning curve and that I had to get used to all the syntax and making sure that I import/include all the necessary files and links. Once I got over that hardship, it made coding HTML much simpler and easier to read. Although I have not used any other framework other than Bootstrap, I highly recommend any software engineer to implement this into their daily coding lives.</p>
