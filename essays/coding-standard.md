## Cleaning Up Lint

Prior to this course, I have never made use of a coding standard or used something to point out formatting mistakes so the idea of ESLint was new to me. I've learned that it is an inspector specifically for Javascript that will not only mark any incorrect areas of code, but will mark any areas in which the formatting could be changed for better clarification. Coding Standards have mixed reviews when it comes to benefitting Software Engineers. Many Engineers may find that the errors that show up are irritating or confusing or simply unecessary, however, coding standards actually may be able to help someone learn a particular language.
