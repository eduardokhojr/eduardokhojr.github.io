## What is it?

Software engineering is not a stranger when it comes to my interests in school. From a young age, computers have been a part of my life whether that be physical components or coding. While developing my software engineering prowess early in my college career through C, I have yet to scratch the surface of what software engineering has to offer. With languages like JavaScript, Python, and C++ just to name a few, I still have not come close to mastering any part of the widely used languages.

## Skills Developed

With the help of my professors, I expect to learn quite a few things out of this class specifically. First, I'd like to do front end engineering which is directly related to website design and appearance. Along with that I would also like to dive deep into the back end side of things and be able to work on the efficiency and functionality. Of course with the expectation I have, the amount of effort needed to successfully learn everything I want is extremely high. However, with the interest that I have, I believe that this is somewhat achieveable and likely to happen this semester.

## For What?

After this class and after I finish my college career, I want to do something involving the things I learned. Whether that be working for a blue chip company, or even using these skills along with my other interests to begin my own startup. With enough time and understanding, these goals are possible and in the near future. Producing projects may be the best way to showcase my learning and progress made and I will be able to demonstrate that via the techfolio that we are currently making.
