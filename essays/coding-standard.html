<h2 id="cleaning-up-lint">Cleaning Up Lint</h2>

<p>Prior to this course, I have never made use of a coding standard or used something to point out formatting mistakes so the idea of ESLint was new to me. I’ve learned that it is an inspector specifically for Javascript that will not only mark any incorrect areas of code, but will mark any areas in which the formatting could be changed for better clarification. Coding Standards have mixed reviews when it comes to benefitting Software Engineers. Many Engineers may find that the errors that show up are irritating or confusing or simply unecessary, however, coding standards actually may be able to help someone learn a particular language.</p>

<p>Now having experience and exposure to using ESLint and IntelliJ, I find myself using it quite often and coding such that no errors arise in the first place. While it may be near impossible to perfect every line of code that I write, I limit the amount of errors made because of how much I do not like seeing them. At first, the errors seemed like they were a bit unecessary, but that was only because I was unfamiliar with the convention. I eventually learned  The errors have helped change my way of coding to a much neater degree. With ESLint and IntelliJ together, I find that I am having a much simpler and more enjoyable time learning Javascript than if I did not have these resources.</p>

<p>Implementing something like ESLint or another language coding standard equivalent is something that I would recommend to anyone that codes. Whether you code daily or any less frequent, a tool like ESLint can not only enhance the way that you approach a code but will help you display a sense of professionalism and knowledge about that specfic languge. While it may not be for everyone, I think coding standards are something that any type of coder should try at least once in their coding career.</p>
