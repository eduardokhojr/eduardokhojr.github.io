## What is it?

During my Fall 2019 semester, for our EE160 final project, our objective was to create a program to keep track of the scores of a bowling game. Our program was able to withstand up to 4 rows of players. Some features of this program included being able to auto detect Turkey and Strike scores depending on what the user enters for that specified turn. The program complies with standard bowling rules and conditions and allows players two bowls per turn while cycling through the rest of the players for ten whole frames.

## Difficulties

Being my first project in my college career, I experienced a multitude of hardships while working on my code. First of them being my overall understanding of the C language. Althought it was the final project of the class, there were still concepts that were taught which were still hard to grasp and was unable to implement correctly into my final code. This meant that my code could have been a lot more smoother and efficient but in the end, it worked out just fine.
