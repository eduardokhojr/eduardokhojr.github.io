## Before The Race

To prepare for this regatta, we began listing out our goals and how to achieve them. We warmed up, and done a few exercises to get our heartrate going. Our goals were to perform better than our previous race which got us into the final round of the seasonal bracket.

## The Start

As we lined up to start the race, we began breathing cool and collectedly so that we were able to focus and exert our energy at the right time to get us a headstart. As the timer counted down, we put our paddles up, and as soon as the light turned green we begun. Due to the months and months of practice of being in sync, our canoe took off.

## The Middle

As we approached the turn, I prepared myself by placing my paddle as far left as I could reach to begin the process. With the support of our fourth and fifth seater, we were able to exit the turn with sufficient speed to approach the final stretch.

## The End.

Neck and neck with other competitors, the result of our race was dependent on this last stretch. As we all exerted our full energy we were able to catch up with a lot of the other canoes but we ended up falling short and placing in a non podium position.
